## Description

I tried to follow the instructions provided on the assignment, not sure if I understood them correctly but I implemented what I understood.

Since the assignment called for a Hexagonal arch I implemented it with an OO approach. I normally don't use OO and this type of architecture, I try to follow a clean arch approach using FP instead on my project. You can see an example of such approach on another test that i took recently at [FP clean arch test](https://github.com/OscarGuerreroLopez/apartment_test_node)

I added some unit test but it does not cover 100% due to lack of time.
